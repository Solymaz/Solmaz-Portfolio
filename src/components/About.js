      <h1>About me</h1>
      <p>
        I Started learning frontend development not long time ago. I like it
        since it is a blend of creativity and logic which is very much me. It is
        also an incredibly powerful skill that enables me to solve daily life
        problems. This is what I am striving for. <br />I am a passionate,
        can-doer, and a detail-oriented person. If you ask my friends and
        colleagues, they would describe me as an energetic woman with contagious
        positive energy. <br />
        When I am not coding, I am most probably either dancing or cooking.
        <br /> I like to work with different projects that challenge me.
        Currently, I am actively looking for a new opportunity. A chance to make
        a positive change while enjoying being surrounded by smart people.
